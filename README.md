## Hello

I'm a software engineer in Austin, Texas. I like to program things that provide benefits.

### Rabbitory

The last thing I did was co-create Rabbitory. It's an open-source RabbitMQ manager. It takes the domain knowledge, SSHing, and headache out of setting up and managing RabbitMQ node(s).
