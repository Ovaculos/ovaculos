## Hello

I'm a software engineer in Austin, Texas.

### [Rabbitory](https://rabbitory.github.io/rabbitory_webpage/)

The last thing I did was co-create Rabbitory. It's an open-source RabbitMQ manager. It takes the domain knowledge, SSHing, and overall headache out of setting up and managing RabbitMQ nodes.

### Skills for Job Bots

Here are all the things I know for job bots: AWS & their SDK (EC2, DynamoDB, IAM, SSM), Bun, CSS, DigitalOcean, Docker, Express, Fly.io, Git, Github, Heroku, HTML, HTTP, JavaScript, Jest, jQuery, Linux, MongoDB, NextJS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, React, REST APIs, Ruby, Sinatra, Tailwind, TypeScript, WebSockets
