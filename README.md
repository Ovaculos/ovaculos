## Hello

I'm a software engineer in Austin, Texas.

### [Rabbitory](https://rabbitory.github.io/rabbitory_webpage/)

The last thing I did was co-create Rabbitory. It's an open-source RabbitMQ manager. It takes the domain knowledge, SSHing, and overall headache out of setting up and managing RabbitMQ nodes.
